# ShieldMaidens_TestReleases

### Version 0.4.2 Notes [July 10, 2021]
- The Berserker pit has been implemented into the game, now you'll have to fight him in his own home!
- The Berserker now has solid lines and has been coloured in to show off his golden headgear.
- He's also been given particle animation, which triggers to show the area of damage from his leaping strike.
- Enemies now flash red to indicate that you've hit them
- Your thrown shield will no longer collide with enemies on return. This is to stop it getting stuck too often.

- Player now flashes red when damage taken.

### Version 0.4 Notes [June 09, 2021]
- ShieldMaidens first boss *The Alchemist* has been introduced! Watch out for poisonous toxins coming through the pipes and be ready to destroy its source by using The Alchemist's own weapons against them. But be careful, once you enter their lair - there's no way out until you make one!
- The Alchemist's chance to appear will increase once you pass your first camp. This is the first boss in the game so they'll likely appear a few times if you play long enough, plans to introduce more will be revealed soon.
- Updated the archer tower, redrew and colored it with perspective as well as splitting the front/back assets to make it interact like a 3d space with the archer inside.
- Co-op can now be enabled/disabled in-game from the pause menu.
- Number of pillage scenes until player camp appears has been reduced.
- Camera Y dampening removed due to getting stuck quite low after coming out of water. Camera Y position also altered so player is still looking relatively close to center of screen when following character whilst still being able to see above archer towers.
- Timer for destroying dead enemy GameObjects reduced from 3s to 2s.

- Old game menu removed and opening menu scene redesigned.
- For saving progress you will find camp sites every so often that auto-save the game.
- The shop will no longer be on the main menu, to spend your gold you'll now find travelling caravan at camp sites.
- Old generated map parts now get destroyed after set distance reached, this also applies to enemies
- Reanimated the fire
- Mages fireball speed increased but longer cast time
- Worked on the visuals by creating 'perspective' such as the angle you see some buildings which now look "3D". Alongside this removed the middle parallax layer.

- Redrew the background hills in pillaging mode
- Fixed the collider on the knight
- Removed camera lookahead, was hard to see what was happening on screen when turning
- UI changes to Opening scene

Spent the last week researching hex-tilemaps as an open world map option but the implementation I had in mind would bring a huge scope creep.
Will continue looking into other options to expand the world
