# ShieldMaidens_TestReleases

### Version 0.3.2 Notes [May 01, 2021]
- Redrew the background hills in pillaging mode
- Fixed the collider on the knight
- Removed camera lookahead, was hard to see what was happening on screen when turning
- UI changes to Opening scene
- UI changes to shop
- Fixed road perspective

Spent the last week researching hex-tilemaps as an open world map option but the implementation I had in mind would bring a huge scope creep.
Will continue looking into other options to expand the world
