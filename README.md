# ShieldMaidens_TestReleases

### Version 0.4.5 Notes [August 20 2021]
- The wall jump mechanic has been removed. Having a double jump made wall jumping excessive and having some walls be climbable and others not was actually just inconsistent & annoying to players. If you're struggling to get over the keeps - try jumping on something else first :)
- Co op is back, you can enable/disable from the settlement from now on. So remember to enable before you head out on a mission with a friend!
- Potions are now kept on you instead of being instantly consumed, you can press the keys 1 & 2 or up/down on a D-Pad. The shop has also been updated to sell potions to take with you.
- Controls list now accessible through the pause menu
- A couple more buildings have been placed, but these ones will cost gold:
  - A Blacksmith can be purchased for your settlement, you will now get health and shield upgrades from there instead of the caravans
  - An Apothecary can also be bought and built, potions can be purchased here for a little less gold than caravans!

### Version 0.4.4 Notes [August 15, 2021]
- You now have a settlement! Starting the game will spawn you there and it will act as your hub
- Settlement building functionality is now in-game. It's currently in a prototype stage but more buildings will be added in the next few versions to aid you on your missions! Just go over to your building bench to get started
- The world map can be found in your settlement and you can select missions by interacting with the questboard
- Eovir is a friendly NPC that will be your trusty advisor and is the first NPC with dialogue! You can interact with him again incase you accidentally skipped
- Camps now spawn right after a boss so you can continue your journey after a hard battle. Any other chance of a camp spawning is now 1 in 6.
- Redesign on the background again, your settlement has it's own variation too
Side note: Couch co-op has been frozen as I'm currently reworking it, thanks for your patience!

### Version 0.4.3 Notes [July 20, 2021]
- The Sorcerer's tower has been revealed, seek her out before she becomes too powerful! Wait for the time to strike, she has her shield up whilst she fights, but becomes vulnerable when summoning allies.
- The Alchemist has been buffed, their poison now does more than x2 more damage and the tank has twice as much health
- The Berserkers walls have been fixed so you dont get stuck on them, also added spikes to make it clear you can't climb them. But don't try - you might just hurt yourself
- During one pillage play-through, bosses will no longer appear again until all other bosses are defeated.
- Scenes now look like you're running through a forest! The current assets are a placeholder until I start the asset redraw phase
- Potions and Coin sprites now glow & are brighter so they stand out more
- Small bugs like the mage's shooting direction lag has been fixed, and archers wont try shooting you through walls anymore

### Version 0.4.2 Notes [July 10, 2021]
- The Berserker pit has been implemented into the game, now you'll have to fight him in his own home!
- The Berserker now has solid lines and has been coloured in to show off his golden headgear.
- He's also been given particle animation, which triggers to show the area of damage from his leaping strike.
- Enemies now flash red to indicate that you've hit them
- Your thrown shield will no longer collide with enemies on return. This is to stop it getting stuck too often.

---

### Version 0.4.1 Notes [July 01, 2021]
- The Berserker has been introduced, keep your distance and dodge those leaping strikes by dashing!
- Player now flashes red when damage taken.
- Player will no longer collide with enemies, meaning you can run through/past them.
- You can now dodge melee attacks (try dashing) before their melee animation hits you.
- Enemies with armor can no longer be knocked back.

### Version 0.4 Notes [June 09, 2021]
- ShieldMaidens first boss *The Alchemist* has been introduced! Watch out for poisonous toxins coming through the pipes and be ready to destroy its source by using The Alchemist's own weapons against them. But be careful, once you enter their lair - there's no way out until you make one!
- The Alchemist's chance to appear will increase once you pass your first camp. This is the first boss in the game so they'll likely appear a few times if you play long enough, plans to introduce more will be revealed soon.
- Updated the archer tower, redrew and colored it with perspective as well as splitting the front/back assets to make it interact like a 3d space with the archer inside.
- Co-op can now be enabled/disabled in-game from the pause menu.
- Number of pillage scenes until player camp appears has been reduced.
- Camera Y dampening removed due to getting stuck quite low after coming out of water. Camera Y position also altered so player is still looking relatively close to center of screen when following character whilst still being able to see above archer towers.
- Timer for destroying dead enemy GameObjects reduced from 3s to 2s.

### Version 0.3.5 Notes [May 11, 2021]
- Old game menu removed and opening menu scene redesigned.
- For saving progress you will find camp sites every so often that auto-save the game.
- The shop will no longer be on the main menu, to spend your gold you'll now find travelling caravan at camp sites.
- Old generated map parts now get destroyed after set distance reached, this also applies to enemies
- Reanimated the fire
- Mages fireball speed increased but longer cast time
- Worked on the visuals by creating 'perspective' such as the angle you see some buildings which now look "3D". Alongside this removed the middle parallax layer.

### Version 0.3.2 Notes [May 01, 2021]
- Redrew the background hills in pillaging mode
- Fixed the collider on the knight
- Removed camera lookahead, was hard to see what was happening on screen when turning
- UI changes to Opening scene

Spent the last week researching hex-tilemaps as an open world map option but the implementation I had in mind would bring a huge scope creep.
Will continue looking into other options to expand the world
